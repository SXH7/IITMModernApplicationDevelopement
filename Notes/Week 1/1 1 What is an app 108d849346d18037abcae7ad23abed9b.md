# Applications divided by platform:

### Desktop apps:

- Usually Standalone.
    - Word editors, web browsers etc.
- Often work offline.
    - Local data storage.
    - Possible online only functionality
- SDK
    - Used to develop apps
    - Custom frameworks usually OS specific.

### Mobile Apps:

- Phones/Tablets
- Limited in capability
    - Limited screen space.
    - Lower memory/processing power.
    - Runs on a battery.
    - Touch interaction.
- Frameworks
    - Some frameworks are OS specific.
    - There are also Cross Platform SDKs. (like Flutter)
- Network centered
    - Mobile devices usually go along with a network to make calls and such.
    - Many mobile apps just connect you to a server, like social media apps. So there are not a lot of standalone mobile apps.

### Web Apps:

- Web apps are a platform.
    - It has become a platform because of programming languages like javascript that can manipulate what happens on the browser itself.
    - Pushes a lot of processing on the users end.
- No compatibility issues.
    - Most big web browsers run on all operating system and their interfaces are more or less the same.
    - This created a common middle ground between all operating systems.
- Heavily network dependent.
