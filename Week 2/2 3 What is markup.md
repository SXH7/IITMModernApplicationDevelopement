# What is markup?

Markup can be thought of as writing on a piece of paper and scribbling on it with instructions on how to show the text (look at 2:55 and 3:55 in video).
We embed information in the content of the text to display it better.

### Procedural Markup

It gives the exact details on how to display the text.

Tells the editor what font something should be, what font size, what colour, etc.

### Descriptive

Describes what the text is. For example this part is a heading, this part is a title, etc. The editor is free to display titles in whichever way it wants to.

### Semantic Markup

Semantics means what is the meaning of the text. WE decide on what we want to do with the text to convey whatever we want to convey.
